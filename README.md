# myDate
This is a project which uses Julian dates to manipulate and manage dates.
The program uses Julian dates to carry out different functions like converting it to a Gregorian date(or vice versa), increasing or decreasing the number of days and also telling what day of the week this date falls on. 
Formulas are used that convert a Gregorian date (example: 5/11/1959) to a Julian date which is the number of days that has elapsed since Nov 28, 4768 BC (or 11/28/-4768).
It uses pass-by-reference parameter passing to implement the JulianToGregorian function since 3 parameters (month, day and year) have to be modified within the function and returned to the calling routine.

The following concepts are used: 
1) Pass by value 
2) Pass by reference
3) Reference variables
4) Creating and Abstract Data Type (a class with associated values and functions) 
5) Checking for valid objects at creation tim
